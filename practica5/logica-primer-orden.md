# First-order logic

- First-order logic is another way of knowledge representation in artificial intelligence. It is an extension to propositional logic.
- FOL is sufficiently expressive to represent the natural language statements in a concise way.
- First-order logic is also known as Predicate logic or First-order predicate logic. First-order logic is a powerful language that develops information about the objects in a more easy way and can also express the relationship between those objects.

# Quantifiers in First-order logic.
- A quantifier is a language element which generates quantification, and quantification specifies the quantity of specimen in the universe of discourse.
- These are the symbols that permit to determine or identify the range and scope of the variable in the logical expression. There are two types of quantifier:
1. Universal Quantifier, (for all, everyone, everything)
2. Existential quantifier, (for some, at least one).


# Universal Quantifier:
- Universal quantifier is a symbol of logical representation, which specifies that the statement within its range is true for everything or every instance of a particular thing.
- The Universal quantifier is represented by a symbol ∀, which resembles an inverted A.

# Existential Quantifier:
- Existential quantifiers are the type of quantifiers, which express that the statement within its scope is true for at least one instance of something.
- It is denoted by the logical operator ∃, which resembles as inverted E. When it is used with a predicate variable then it is called as an existential quantifier.


# Points to remember:
- The main connective for universal quantifier ∀ is implication →.
- The main connective for existential quantifier ∃ is and ∧.


1. All birds fly.
In this question the predicate is "fly(bird)."
And since there are all birds who fly so it will be represented as follows.
 ∀x bird(x) →fly(x).
